What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge takes the changes from one branch and adds them to the current 
branch, whereas a rebase takes the current branch and places all it's 
commits after another branch.
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a repository outside of your own computer that 
stores your project files, such at Github.
